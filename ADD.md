# SFCulture APP

##Objective
SFCulture is a more direct way for people in their regions to interact and participate with their respective cultures. Despite the movement of diversity in this globalized world, individualized culture still plays a powerful role in interpersonal interactions and the construction of community, and is an organic part of human nature. At the moment, the closest thing to digitalized cultural interaction is at the level of Facebook pages (i.e. Egyptians in SF, Chinese in Boston, etc.) and the like, which ultimately provides an experience that is anchored on the surface level, with very little incentive for an interactive community. SFCulture provides a platform solely dedicated to reaching out and being a part of the community in your area, bypassing the barriers present in general social networks and specialized dating sites (which have a negative connotation and ultimately are not made for communities).

##Audience
Most, if not all, people have a distinct culture that they identify with. Whether it is race, religion, or common upbringings, people naturally have distinct attributes and an inclination to participate with others who match these general traits. The audience could be immigrants from others countries looking for their familiar communities in a new environment, in which SFCulture allows both an assimilation into a new society (which ultimately promotes globalization in the end), as well as a community to lean on. It also could be indivuals simply looking to connect, or even reconnect, with their heritage community, bringing culture both into their own lives, as well as inject a bit of culture into their region as a whole. At the moment, we are focusing this app on the SF/Bay Area region (which definitely needs some culture reinjection), but in theory there should not be an area that cannot benefit from this app.
